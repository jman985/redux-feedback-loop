# PROJECT NAME
Redux Feedback Loop

## Description

_Duration: 2-Day Project_

This project seeks to create an online feedback form for Prime Academy to collect feedback data from Prime students.  The form asks each student to rate their feelings, understanding of the material, and the supportiveness of Prime on a scale of 1 to 5, as well as enter any lingering comments.  Before submitting the form, the student has the opportunity to review their answers.  Upon submission, the student's answers are saved to a database.  Finally, the student has the option to restart the feedback survey.
